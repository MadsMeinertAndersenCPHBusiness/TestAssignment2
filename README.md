## Computer mouse

Firstly I would do unit tests. Where I isolate the mouse and make sure it works on its own. Testing all its functions, right-click, left-click, double-click etc.

Afterwords I would probably do an Integration Test, where I actually test if it works with a computer. 

At last I would perform user testing, to get some feedback from other individuals.


## Catastrophic failure
### The Mars Climate Orbiter
The Mars Climate Orbiter was a robot developed by NASA to study the climate on Mars. The orbiter was launched on December 11 1998, however the orbiter didn't live for long. Due to an misunderstanding between NASA and one if it's subcontractors, the orbiter used English units instead of the intended metric system, nearly a year after the orbiter was launch and reached mars, one of the thrusters malfunctioned, which caused the orbiter to crash. This mistake cost $327 MILLION and probably could have been prevented if some simple unit tests would have been performed. 


## Investagation of tools

### JUnit 5

### Mocking Frameworks
